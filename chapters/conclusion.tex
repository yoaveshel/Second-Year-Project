\chapter{Conclusion}
Throughout this paper, we have not discussed the application of the $p$-adic number so it is natural to wonder about the purpose of this particular topic. To that end, readers can rest assured because the study of $p$-adic numbers has far reaching applications in a variety of field such as number theory, Diophantine's geometry, etc. One important theorem, which usefulness is immediate, stemmed from the study of the $p$-adic numbers is the Hasse Principle \cite{hasse} which essentially states that a certain types of equation have a rational solution if and only if they have a solution in $\R$ and $\Q_p$ for all $p$. 
The world of $p$-adic numbers is wonderful, weird and enormous, and there are far too many interesting properties and results to list them all.
