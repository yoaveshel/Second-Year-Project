# Abstract
The $p$-adic numbers and $p$-adic metric are introduced, and various relevant properties are proved. 
The field $\mathbb{Q}_p$ is then constructed as the completion of $\Q$ with respect to the $p$-adic absolute value and Hensel's lemma is proved using an iterative method.
It is then shown that $\mathbb{Q}_p$ is not algebraically closed and its algebraic closure is $\overline{\mathbb{Q}_p}$ is not complete.
The field $\Cp$ is constructed as the completion of the algebraic closure of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and Newton polygons are discussed as an example of analysis in $\mathbb{C}_p$.
