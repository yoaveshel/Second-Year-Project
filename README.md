# Abstract
The $p$-adic numbers and $p$-adic metric are introduced, and various relevant properties are proved. 
The field $\Qp$ is then constructed as the completion of $\Q$ with respect to the $p$-adic absolute value and Hensel's lemma is proved using an iterative method.
It is then shown that $\Qp$ is not algebraically closed and its algebraic closure is $\overline{\Qp}$ is not complete.
The field $\Cp$ is constructed as the completion of the algebraic closure of $\Qp$ and Newton polygons are discussed as an example of analysis in $\Cp$.
